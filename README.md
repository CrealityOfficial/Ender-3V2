# Issues and Suggestions
Your feedback is very important to us, as it helps us improve even faster. Feel free to feedback us if there is an issue.
In order to get responses in an efficient way, we recommend you to follow some guidelines:
1. First of all, search for related issues.
2. Detail the firmware version you're running.
3. Explain to us the error or bug, so that we can test it properly.
4. In the title, indicate the label of the issue. (For example: #issue)

# Development Process
The code is currently in development, trying to improve functionalities.
Since it’s possible for the advanced users to contribute in firmware development, we suppose you know the points even if they have not been clearly illustrated by Creality.

The master branch is stable and it's currently of the version 2.0.x. The master branch stores code created by Creality. Once a release is done, the users, get to upgrade the version and give feedback to us. We get to know the bugs as well as optimization based on the feedback from you and Creality will make a decision on what to be included into the master branch. 

By integrating suggested improvements, we will make a branch from the version.

This is a classic code development process and we want more, so we really want you to participate from the very beginning.
